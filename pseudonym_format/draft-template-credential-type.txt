                   Multipass Credential Type Template
                 draft-template-credential-type-latest

Abstract

   User authentication and attributes are exchanged online today between
   organizations based on bilateral business arrangements, with user
   consent and privacy provided as desired by the organization(s)
   involved.

   Multipass is a system intended for an organization to issue
   credentials unilaterally, where other organizations can evaluate
   credentials without having a relationship to the issuing party.  This
   is accomplished by leveraging a software agent, which allows this
   exchange to be done in a manner that is able to respect user privacy
   and support informed decisions around disclosure.

   This specification defines a credential type to DO STUFF.

1.  Introduction

   Multipass describes a process for retrieving and handling a set of
   credentials from a single issuer, known as a _Multipass Container_.
   These containers are single use, cryptographically verifiable
   statements by a particular issuer, containing or referencing
   credentials of various types - representing user attributes,
   authentication, and authorization.  Multipass also defines mechanisms
   to prove possession of a key associated with the container to the
   relying party, and for verifying the credentials were asserted by the
   issuer.

   This specification describes the data expected in a request by a
   party for a particular type of credential (CREDENTIAL NAME), as well
   as the cryptographic format of the presentation of this credential
   back to the requesting party.

   document in lower case as plain English words, absent their normative
   meanings.

   Certain security-related terms are to be understood in the sense
   defined in [SECURITY].  These terms may include, but are not limited
   to, "air gap", "anonymity", "assymmetric cryptography", "attribute",
   "authentication", "authorization", "certificate", "challenge-
   response", "credential", "data integrity", "domain", "domain name",
   "enclave", "encryption", "ephemeral key", "expire", "fresh",
   "identifier", "identity", "identity proofing", "integrity",
   "privacy", "private key", "proof-of-possession", "protocol", "public
   key", "repudiation", "sign", "signature", "single sign-on",
   "steganography", "trust", "validate", "validity period", "verify",
   and "zero-knowledge proof"

   Unless otherwise noted, all the protocol parameter names and values
   are case sensitive.

   This specification also leverages the terms and roles defined in
   [draft-waite-multipass-retrieval]
